## Perform a basic search

Over 100,000 events are contained in the main index across all time

## Evaluate the field

`host`: The host field specifies the name of the network host from which the event originated. In this search there are five hosts:

* mailsv - Buttercup Games' mail server. Examine events generated from this host.

* www1 - This is one of Buttercup Games' web applications.

* www2 - This is one of Buttercup Games' web applications.

* www3 - This is one of Buttercup Games' web applications.

* vendor_sales - Information about Buttercup Games' retail sales.

`source`: The source field indicates the file name from which the event originates. Notice /mailsv/secure.log, which is a log file that contains information related to authentication and authorization attempts on the mail server.

`sourcetype`: The sourcetype determines how data is formatted.

## Narrow the search

`index=main host=mailsv`

The search results have narrowed to over 9000 events that are generated by the mail server.

## Search for a failed login for root

`index=main host=mailsv fail* root`

> This search expands on the search from the previous task and searches for the keyword fail*. The wildcard tells Splunk to expand the search term to find other terms that contain the word fail such as failure, failed, etc. Lastly, the keyword root searches for any event that contains the term root.
