## Scenario

Youâ€™re a network analyst who needs to use `tcpdump` to capture and analyze live network traffic from a Linux virtual machine.

The lab starts with your user account, called `analyst`, already logged in to a Linux terminal.

## Identify network interfaces

`sudo ifconfig`

The Ethernet network interface is identified by the entry with the `eth` prefix.

`sudo tcpdump -D`

This command will also allow you to identify which network interfaces are available. This may be useful on systems that do not include the ifconfig command.

## Inspect the network traffic of a network interface with tcpdump

Filter live network packet data from the `eth0` interface with `tcpdump`: 

`sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -v -c5`
* `-i eth0`: Capture data specifically from the eth0 interface.
* `-v`: Display detailed packet data.
* `-c5`: Capture 5 packets of data.

## Capture network traffic with tcpdump

1. Capture packet data into a file called `capture.pcap`

`sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -nn -c9 port 80 -w capture.pcap &`

* `-i eth0`: Capture data from the eth0 interface.
* `-nn`: Do not attempt to resolve IP addresses or ports to names.This is best practice from a security perspective, as the lookup data may not be valid. It also prevents malicious actors from being alerted to an investigation.
* `-c9`: Capture 9 packets of data and then exit.
* `port 80`: Filter only port 80 traffic. This is the default HTTP port.
* `-w capture.pcap`: Save the captured data to the named file.
* `&`: This is an instruction to the Bash shell to run the command in the background.

2. Use `curl` to generate some HTTP (port 80) traffic:

`curl opensource.google.com`

When the `curl` command is used like this to open a website, it generates some HTTP (TCP port 80) traffic that can be captured.

3. Verify that packet data has been captured:

`ls -l capture.pcap`

## Filter the captured packet data

1. Use the tcpdump command to filter the packet header data from the `capture.pcap` capture file:

`sudo tcpdump -nn -r capture.pcap -v`

* `-nn`: Disable port and protocol name lookup.
* `-r`: Read capture data from the named file.
* `-v`: Display detailed packet data.

2. Use the tcpdump command to filter the extended packet data from the `capture.pcap` capture file:

`sudo tcpdump -nn -r capture.pcap -X`

* `-nn`: Disable port and protocol name lookup.
* `-r`: Read capture data from the named file.
* `-X`: Display the hexadecimal and ASCII output format packet data. Security analysts can analyze hexadecimal and ASCII output to detect patterns or anomalies during malware analysis or forensic analysis.
