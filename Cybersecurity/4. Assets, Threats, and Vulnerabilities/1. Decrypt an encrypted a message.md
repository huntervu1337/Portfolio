# Decrypt an encrypted a message

## Scenario 

In this scenario, all of the files in your home directory have been encrypted. You’ll need to use Linux commands to break the Caesar cipher and decrypt the files so that you can read the hidden messages they contain.

Here’s how you’ll do this task: First, you’ll explore the contents of the home directory and read the contents of a file. Next, you’ll find a hidden file and decrypt the Caesar cipher it contains. Finally, you’ll decrypt the encrypted data file to recover your data and reveal the hidden message.

OK, it's time to decrypt some messages in Linux!

Note: The lab starts with you logged in as user `analyst`, with your home directory, `/home/analyst`, as the current working directory.

## Solution

### I. Read the contents of a file

1. List the files in the current working directory: `ls /home/analyst` or `ls`

2. List the contents of the README.txt file: `cat README.txt`

### II. Find the hidden file

1.  Change to the caesar subdirectory: `cd caesar`

2.  List all files, including hidden files: `ls -a`

3.  `cat .leftShift3`

The message in the .leftShift3 file appears to be scrambled. This is because the data has been encrypted using a Caesar cipher. This cipher can be solved by shifting each alphabet character to the left or right by a fixed number of spaces. In this example, the shift is three letters to the left. Thus "d" stands for "a", and "e" stands for "b".

4. Decrypt the Caesar cipher in the .leftshift3: `cat .leftShift3 | tr "d-za-cD-ZA-C" "a-zA-Z"`

   > The tr command translates text from one set of characters to another, using a mapping. The first parameter to the tr command represents the input set of characters, and the second represents the output set of characters. Hence, if you provide parameters “abcd” and “pqrs”, and the input string to the tr command is “ac”, the output string will be “pr".

### III. Decrypt the file

`openssl aes-256-cbc -pbkdf2 -a -d -in Q1.encrypted -out Q1.recovered -k ettubrute`

> In this instance, the openssl command reverses the encryption of the file with a secure symmetric cipher, as indicated by AES-256-CBC. The -pbkdf2 option is used to add extra security to the key, and -a indicates the desired encoding for the output. The -d indicates decrypting, while -in specifies the input file and -out specifies the output file. The -k specifies the password, which in this example is ettubrute.

Final output:
