## Scenario

Youâ€™ll analyze a network packet capture file that contains traffic data related to a user connecting to an internet site. The ability to filter network traffic using packet sniffers to gather relevant information is an essential skill as a security analyst.

You must filter the data in order to:

identify the source and destination IP addresses involved in this web browsing session,
examine the protocols that are used when the user makes the connection to the website, and
analyze some of the data packets to identify the type of information sent and received by the systems that connect to each other when the network data is captured.

## Explore data with Wireshark

* No. : The index number of the packet in this packet capture file
* Time: The timestamp of the packet
* Source: The source IP address
* Destination: The destination IP address
* Protocol: The protocol contained in the packet
* Length: The total length of the packet
* Info: Some infomation about the data in the packet (the payload) as interpreted by Wireshark

## Apply a basic Wireshark filter and inspect a packet

`ip.addr == 142.250.1.139`

## Use filters to explore DNS & TCP packets

`udp.port == 53`
`tcp.port == 80`
