## Scenario

You are a security analyst at a financial services company. You receive an alert that an employee received a phishing email in their inbox. You review the alert and identify a suspicious domain name contained in the email's body: `signin.office365x24.com`. You need to determine whether any other employees have received phishing emails containing this domain and whether they have visited the domain. You will use Chronicle to investigate this domain.

2. `TIMELINE`: reveal the details about the HTTP requests made, including GET and POST requests. The POST information is especially useful because it means that data was sent to the domain. It also suggests a possible successful phish

## Investigate the resolved IP address

So far, you have collected information about the domain's reputation using threat intelligence, and you've identified the assets and events associated with the domain. Based on this information, it's clear that this domain is suspicious and most likely malicious. But before you can confirm that it is malicious, there's one last thing to investigate.

Attackers sometimes reuse infrastructure for multiple attacks. In these cases, multiple domain names resolve to the same IP address.

Investigate the IP address found under the `RESOLVED IPS` insight card to identify if the `signin.office365x24.com` domain uses another domain

1. Investigate IP address `40.100.174.34`

2. There are 3 `POST` requests were made to the the IP address `40.100.174.34`

3. The target URL of the web page that the `POST` requests were made to is `http://signin.office365x24.com/login.php`
