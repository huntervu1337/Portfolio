## Scenario

You are a level one security operations center (SOC) analyst at a financial services company. You have received an alert about a suspicious file being downloaded on an employee's computer. 

You investigate this alert and discover that the employee received an email containing an attachment. The attachment was a password-protected spreadsheet file. The spreadsheet's password was provided in the email. The employee downloaded the file, then entered the password to open the file. When the employee opened the file, a malicious payload was then executed on their computer. 

You retrieve the malicious file and create a SHA256 hash of the file. You might recall from a previous course that a hash function is an algorithm that produces a code that can't be decrypted. Hashing is a cryptographic method used to uniquely identify malware, acting as the file's unique fingerprint.

### SHA256 file hash: `54e6ea47eb04634d3e87fd7787e2136ccfbcc80ade34f246a12cf93bab527f6b`

Here is a timeline of the events leading up to this alert:

* 1:11 p.m.: An employee receives an email containing a file attachment.

* 1:13 p.m.: The employee successfully downloads and opens the file.

* 1:15 p.m.: Multiple unauthorized executable files are created on the employee's computer.

* 1:20 p.m.: An intrusion detection system detects the executable files and sends out an alert to the SOC.
