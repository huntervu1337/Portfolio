# Create hash values

## Scenario

As a security analyst, you’ll need to implement security controls to protect organizations against a range of threats.

That’s where hashing comes in. Previously, you learned that a hash function is an algorithm that produces a code that can’t be decrypted. Hash functions are used to uniquely identify the contents of a file so that you can check whether it has been modified. This code provides a unique identifier known as a hash value or digest.

For example, a malicious program may mimic an original program. If one code line is different from the original program, it produces a different hash value. Security teams can then identify the malicious program and work to mitigate the risk.

Many tools are available to compare hashes for various scenarios. But for a security analyst it’s important to know how to manually compare hashes.

In this scenario, you need to investigate whether two files are identical or different.

## I. Generate hashes for files

1. Two files, `file1.txt` and `file2.txt`, are listed

2. The contents of the two files appear identical when you use the cat command to display the file contents.

Although the contents of both files appear identical when you use the cat command, you need to generate the hash for each file to determine if the files are actually different.

3. `sha256sum file1.txt ` and `sha256sum file2.txt `

## II. Compare hashes

Although the content in file1.txt and file2.txt previously appeared identical, the hashes written to the file1hash and file2hash files are completely different.

1. Generate the hash of the `file1.txt` file, and send the output to a new file called `file1hash`. Do the same for `file2.txt`:

   `sha256sum file1.txt >> file1hash
    sha256sum file2.txt >> file2hash`
   
3. Highlight the differences in the file1hash and file2hash files: `cmp file1hash file2hash`

> The output of the `cmp` command indicates that the hashes differ at the first character in the first line.
